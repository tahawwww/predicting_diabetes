# End-to-End ML Assignment: Building a Machine Learning Pipeline

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will build a complete Machine Learning pipeline from data cleaning to deployment. The assignment is divided into five main parts:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Model Building
3. Model Saving and Loading
4. FastAPI Endpoint for the Model
5. Deployment at Hugging Face with a Simple UI using Gradio or Streamlit

## Dataset
The data set is provided is the repository.
Make sure that the path is correct and also make sure the saved model has the correct path 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Libraries**: Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib fastapi uvicorn imbalanced-learn gradio  # or streamlit
